    + If packages aren't installed yet, do so.

# Load the data
```{r, eval=FALSE}

# Download Data
##CoronaNet Core Data: 

download.file("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/saudiwin/corona_tscs/master/data/CoronaNet/coronanet_release.csv", "./data/coronanet_release.csv")

##CoronaNet All Vars Data: 

download.file("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/saudiwin/corona_tscs/master/data/CoronaNet/coronanet_release_allvars.csv", "./data/coronanet_release_allvars.csv")

#Load data

coronaNet <- read.csv('data/coronanet_release.csv')

# Worldbank Data 

# Datasets can come from a variety of sources. 
# Today we will be investigating GDP data from the World Bank and Penn World Tables in particular
 

## * Getting World Bank Data: * 
#   i) Go to the https://data.worldbank.org
#  ii) Search for the indicator that you want
# iii) Download the corresponding data in .csv format


## How to load .csvs
# First identify where your downloaded .csv is located....
# ..... or probably better, put your downloaded .csv in a specified place and note the file path
# (the file path is the path to your file of interest.)

# then there are any number of ways you can try to access your data

# a) directly type in the file path


 
wb <- read.csv('data/API_NY.GDP.PCAP.PP.CD_DS2_en_csv_v2_988619.csv',stringsAsFactors = FALSE,  header = TRUE, skip = 4)


```

## Explore the Data
```{r, eval=FALSE}
# lets take a look at the first 6 rows
head(coronaNet)

# lets take a look at what classes the different data are stored in and the values they can take on
str(coronaNet)

# lets take a look at the distribution of the countries that have initiated a policy
table(coronaNet$country)%>% sort(decreasing = TRUE) 

# lets look at the distribution of different policies
table(coronaNet$type) %>% sort()

# Class question: how could you look at the distribution of different sub-types: type_sub_cat ? 

names(coronaNet)

```

## Clean the Data

```{r, eval=FALSE}
coronaNet  = coronaNet %>% 
  mutate(type = ifelse(type == 'Quarantine/Lockdown', 'Lockdown', type)) #We want the variable Quarantine/Lockdown to be called "Lockdown"


# We want to gather the WB data and reshape it in order to have the right merging data

# Gather data: 
stocks <- tibble(
  time = as.Date('2009-01-01') + 0:9,
  X = rnorm(10, 0, 1),
  Y = rnorm(10, 0, 2),
  Z = rnorm(10, 0, 4)
)

stocks

gather(stocks, "stock", "price", -time)
stocks %>% gather("stock", "price", -time) %>% data.frame()

# Now with the Worldbank Data

wb = wb %>% gather("year", "gdpPPP", -`Country Name`, -`Country Code`, -`Indicator Name`, -`Indicator Code`, -X65)

?gather

wb = wb %>% select( -`Indicator Name`, -`Indicator Code`, -X65)
wb$year = as.numeric(wb$year)
wb$lgdpPPP= log(wb$gdpPPP)

```

# Subset the Data
```{r, eval=FALSE}

# LetÂ´s assume we are only interested in the Business Restrictions

businessRestrict = coronaNet %>% filter(type == "Restriction of Non-Essential Businesses")

# what are the dimensions of this new subsetted data?
dim(businessRestrict)
# which countries have instituted restrictions of non-essential businesses?

businessRestrict$country %>% unique()
unique(businessRestrict$country)


# what are the different sub types for the broader non-essentital businesses policy type?
unique(businessRestrict$type_sub_cat)


```


# Merge data 
```{r, eval=FALSE}
# We want to merge the information on GDP per Capita to the CoronaNet data
# This means we will have countries as the identifier 


names(wb)[1] = 'country'

names(businessRestrict)

data = merge(businessRestrict, wb %>% filter(year == 2018), by= 'country', all.x = TRUE)


# how can we find out what gdp of the Germany is in this 'data'?
data %>% filter(country == 'Germany') %>% select(gdpPPP)


# how can we find out what the gdp of the United States is in this data?
data %>% filter(country == 'United States of America') %>% select(gdpPPP)


# how can we investigate which countries match across different datasets?
intersect(coronaNet$country, wb$country)


# and the countries that don't match?
cbind(setdiff(coronaNet$country, wb$country), 
      setdiff( wb$country, coronaNet$country)) %>% head()



# The problem: The country names differ between both datasets. We therefore take the country code (ISO3) as an optimal unique identifieer

names(wb)[2] = 'ccode'
names(businessRestrict)[31] = 'ccode'


data = merge(businessRestrict, wb %>% filter(year == 2018), by= 'ccode', all.x = TRUE)

# how can we find out what the gdp of the United States is in this data?
data %>% filter(ccode == 'USA') %>% select(gdpPPP)

# IT WORKED!
```
