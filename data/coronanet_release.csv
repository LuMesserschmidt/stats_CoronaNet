The amended order includes a new requirement that all retail operations that are considered essential businesses – including grocery stores – shall limit occupancy in their retail spaces. The maximum number of customers in the retail space must be equal to 20 percent or less of the maximum occupancy of the retail space, as determined by the relevant fire marshal or fire department.

If and when customers are waiting outside of a retail space, they must do so in compliance with social distancing protocols including the requirement that they maintain a distance of at least six-feet from other individuals and avoid person-to-person contact.

Hotels, motels, RV parks, and other places of lodging shall not operate at more than 25 percent of maximum occupancy, per the amended order. This is reduced from 50 percent.

• Healthcare: Yesterday the Governor signed an executive order to relax onerous regulations and eliminate barriers to care during this crisis. The order includes the following protections through May 27th: o Medications: Insurers cannot make changes to what drugs are covered unless the changes benefit patients. o Provider Referrals: Insurers are required to relax the referral process to allow for more time and leniency. No referrals are necessary for telehealth. o Prior Authorization: In-patient hospital and rehabilitation, long-term care and telemedicine in-network services cannot be suspended because an individual doesn't have prior authorization. In addition, no prior authorization is needed for testing or treatment of COVID-19. o Behavioral Healthcare: No referrals or other benefit review approvals are required for a patient to access needed mental and behavioral health care. • DMV: The state is now giving 90-day extensions on expirations set for May. Expiration dates in May are now extended to August.

The Council draws guidelines for the sermons delivered in more than 600 locations across the country after the prayers every week. The members of the Council are appointed by the Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei.

According to Haj Ali-Akbar prayers are cancelled in all province capitals but in other cities a committee consisting of the representative of the Supreme Leader, governor and the director-general of the city will make a decision whether to allow the prayers to be held or not.

Some influential clerics such as Ahmad Alam ol-Hoda, Friday Prayer Leader of Mashhad, and Mohammad Saeedi, Custodian of Masoumeh Shrine in Qom, had strongly opposed cancellation of communal prayers and closing shrines.""",1,Restrictions of Mass Gatherings,NA,NA,52.43445558848157,51.61258423323477,50.62313915035979,183,original,Iran,National,NA,NA,NA,Iran,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,All Residents (Citizen Residents +Foreign Residents),NA,NA,Mandatory (Unspecified/Implied),"National Government,Other (Please specify in the text box)",https://en.radiofarda.com/a/iran-cancels-friday-prayers-again-due-to-coronavirus/30469021.html,IRN,IR

The decision to close off a road to cars to increase seating capacity will only be taken ‘if accessibility of facilities and the general traffic flow allow’, the mayor said in a letter announcing the new measures, and ‘only if enough space remains for passers-by and other traffic streams’. Entrepreneurs in narrow streets such as the Negen Straatjes in the Jordaan area of Amsterdam and the Utrechtsestraat, where keeping a safe distance from cyclists and pedestrians is impossible, have already submitted a plan. All requests will be processed as a matter of urgency but owners who join forces to devise a plan will be prioritised,  the paper said.

CARSON CITY, NV - April 27, 2020

Nevada Governor Steve Sisolak and Colorado Governor Jared Polis today announced their respective states are joining California, Oregon and Washington in the Western States Pact -- a working group of Western state governors with a shared vision for modifying stay at home and fighting COVID-19.

“I’m honored to have the State of Nevada join the Western States Pact and believe the sharing of critical information and best practices on how to mitigate the spread, protect the health and safety of our residents, and reopen responsibly will be invaluable as we chart our paths forward,” said Governor Steve Sisolak. “Millions of visitors from our fellow Western states travel to Nevada every year as a premier tourism destination, and this partnership will be vital to our immediate recovery and long-term economic comeback.”

“Coloradans are working together to slow the spread of COVID-19 and have important information to share with and to gain from other states.  I’m thrilled Colorado is joining the Western States Pact,” said Colorado Governor Jared Polis. “There’s no silver bullet that will solve this pandemic until there is a cure so we must have a multifaceted and bold approach in order to slow the spread of the virus, to keep our people safe and help our economy rebound.”

California Governor Gavin Newsom, Oregon Governor Kate Brown and Washington Governor Jay Inslee recently announced they would be working together under a shared vision for gradually modifying their state’s stay at home orders and fighting COVID-19. They listed three shared principles as foundational to the agreement:

    Our residents’ health comes first. As home to nearly one in five Americans and gateway to the rest of the world, the West Coast has an outsized stake in controlling and ultimately defeating COVID-19.
    Health outcomes and science – not politics – will guide these decisions. Modifications to our states’ stay at home orders must be made based off our understanding of the total health impacts of COVID-19, including: the direct impact of the disease on our communities; the health impact of measures introduced to control the spread in communities —particularly felt by those already experiencing social disadvantage prior to COVID-19; and our health care systems’ ability to ensure care for those who may become sick with COVID-19 and other conditions. This effort will be guided by data. We need to see a decline in the rate of spread of the virus before large-scale reopening, and we will be working in coordination to identify the best metrics to guide this.
    Our states will only be effective by working together. Each state will work with its local leaders and communities within its borders to understand what’s happening on the ground and adhere to our agreed upon approach.

As part of the Western States Pact, the Governors commit to working together toward the following four goals

    Protecting vulnerable populations at risk for severe disease if infected. This includes a concerted effort to prevent and fight outbreaks in nursing homes and other long-term care facilities.
    Ensuring an ability to care for those who may become sick with COVID-19 and other conditions. This will require adequate hospital surge capacity and supplies of personal protective equipment.
    Mitigating the non-direct COVID-19 health impacts, particularly on disadvantaged communities.
    Protecting the general public by ensuring any successful lifting of interventions includes the development of a system for testing, tracking and isolating. The states will work together to share best practices.
